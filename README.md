# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Kathirvel

## About Me

Iâ€™m curious about how technology and data can solve real-life problems. I spend most of my time learning new concepts and putting them into practice through small projects and coding challenges.

Right now, Iâ€™m building my skills in:
- Python programming
- SQL
- Basic Data Science
- Problem Solving
- Communication

I believe in learning by doing â€” so I practice coding daily on platforms like HackerRank and FreeCodeCamp.

## What Iâ€™m Working On

- Completing the Google Data Analytics Specialization on Coursera
- Strengthening my Python and SQL through daily practice
- Working on small personal projects and sharing them here
- Exploring open-source contributions in my second year
