## About Me

As a prospective student of AI and data science, I enjoy using technology and data to solve practical issues.
I'm laying a solid basis in:

📌 **Programming in Python**
📌 **SQL**
📌 **Data Science Foundations** 
📌 **Solving Problems** 
📌 **Communication Skills**

I firmly believe in *learning by doing*, so I dedicate time each day to coding, practicing on sites like FreeCodeCamp and HackerRank, and working on small projects.

## Present Learning Objectives

✔️ Finish the Google Data Analytics Specialization on Coursera 
✔️ Create mini-projects and post them here 
✔️ Finish the Python and SQL domains on HackerRank By the second year, begin making contributions to open-source projects.
