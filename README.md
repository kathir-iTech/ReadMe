## 🌟 About Me

I’m curious about how data and technology can solve everyday problems and improve lives.  
I love *learning by doing* — from writing simple Python scripts to exploring beginner-level data science tasks.

Right now, I’m building my foundation in:
- 🐍 Python Programming
- 🗂️ SQL
- 📊 Data Science Basics
- 🧩 Problem Solving
- 🗣️ Communication Skills

Every day, I spend time coding on platforms like HackerRank and FreeCodeCamp, working on small tasks, and exploring new tools.

## 🎯 Current Focus

✅ Completing the Google Data Analytics Specialization (Coursera)  
✅ Strengthening Python & SQL through daily practice  
✅ Creating mini-projects and sharing them here on GitHub  
✅ Planning to join open-source contributions by my second year

## ✨ Beyond Coding

When I’m not learning tech, you’ll find me reading about gadgets, learning new languages, or catching up with friends and family.  
I believe *good ideas grow when we share and build together*.
